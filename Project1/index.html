        <h2><u>The History</u></h2>
        <p>The Avengers, a team of extraordinary individuals with superpowers or special
        characteristics, were assembled in 2012 by S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect global stability 
        from inner or extraterrestrial threats, notably stopping Loki's Chitauri invasion 
        in the Battle of New York.</p>
        <h2><u>The Strongest Avenger</u></h2>
        <p>1# The HULK because of his his immense physical strength and 
        durability, capable of feats that other Avengers, like Thanos, can't match.</p>
        <p>3# God of thunder Thor Thor is to be the third strongest Avenger, after Scarlet Witch 
        and Captain Marvel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Strongest</li>
            <li>3rd Stongest</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>What's Your Favorite Marval movie</u></h2>
        <p>My favorite that's always going to be, when watching marval and how it became today,
        to me it's going to be Avengers: Endgame why you say? Because it had so many great moments<p>
        </p>
        <p>throughout the whole film. Which most of those scenes were shocking, but overall it had a great
        ending, out of all the avengers movies that were made. This one is up there in the ranks of the best movie
        of all time.</p>

        <p>The Avengers and its three sequels are the crowning achievements of the MCU, but while
        they're all iconic in there own ways they don't all reach the same heights. While team-ups and
        crossovers are now an assumed part of every Marval Studios release, it can be difficult to</p>
        <p>remember just how groundbreaking it was to see Nick Fury recruit Tony Stark for the Avengers
        Initiative and later get six iconic heroes together in the same film.</p>
